# KaggleReverseGameOfLife
This Repository Contains Notebooks Used In Conway'a Reverse Game of Life Kaggle Competition

**Data Description : **
1. Each board in this game contains 400 cells (20x20)
2. Train data contains start state of the board and end state of the board
3. We have to predict start state of the board given end state
4. Each row corresponds to a unique game
5. Delta column denotes number of steps that lead to end state (0-5)

**I will add my notebooks exploring different methodologies **

1. Basic Models with start state and end state data - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
2. Basic Models with additional data like Delta
3. Neural Network - CNN and Others
4. Fine tuned best ML model
5. Fine tuned best Neural N/W model
